# Tracks in the Dark - Data

This directory contains data files that you may need for your project.
Each file surves a specific purpose and is organized in a way to help you easily find what you need.
This README.md file provides an overview of the contents of the `data/` directory and how to use the files within it.


## log.*.json

The `log.*.json` files contain the log data for each run of the simulation.
Each file corresponds to a different run and complexity of the simulation.
They can be used for both the simulation and the visualization.
The following files are included:

- `log.basic.json`: Contains a basic run, with a single train. It leaves a 20 axles in the yard.
- `log.medium.json`: Adds direction to the axle counter data, having the engine leave the yard where it entered.
- `log.advanced.json`: Adds more trains, adding emplacement operations.
- `log.advanced.broken.json`: A broken log file, with missing data and inconsistencies.
  - Missing data: a sensor didn't trigger, so there is no log entry for it.
  - Miscount: a sensor triggered, but the data is incorrect.
  - Clock drift: the timestamps are not consistent.
  - Sensor failure: a worker removed a sensor and put it back incorrectly, it now triggers the wrong way.
- `log.expert.json`: Adds schedule and car information to the log; requires merging data with `schedule.json` and `cars.json` to get.
- `log.expert.broken.json`: A broken log file, with missing data and inconsistencies.


## yard.json

The `yard.json` file contains information about the layout of the yard.
Its purpose is to provide information as a data structure, *not* as a visual representation.

After the name of the yard, a list of sensors is provided.
There are two types of sensors: `axle_counter` and `switch_sensors`.
The axle counter count the number of axles that pass by, while the switch sensors detect the state of the switches in the yard.

Following the sensors, a list of tracks is provided.
Each track has a name, an incoming axle_counter, an outgoing axle_counter, and a type.
A track can be a `main` track, for driving, a `siding` for emplacement purposes, or an `edge` for tracks that enter or leave the yard. 

Finally, a list of connections is provided.
A connection has a name, a list of incoming tracks, a list of outgoing tracks, and a type.
The type of a connection can be `switch` and `corner`, which are rather self-explanatory.
A corner always has a single incoming and outgoing track, while a switch can have multiple incoming and outgoing tracks.
In case of a switch, the total number of tracks is always 3.
The first items in both the incoming and outgoing tracks are the straight track, the second item is the diverging track.
